This article aims to expose an approach of how to work using the git flow. [Using the Git Flow](https://medium.com/trainingcenter/using-o-fluxo-git-flow-e63d5e0d5e04).

If you already work with git as the main version control tool, you may have seen several approaches on how to use and control branchs in a production or personal setting.

And if you're new to git, this flow will help you become more familiar with how companies, open source projects often use their workflows.

It is very common to see people using only one branch to commit to personal projects. This is not wrong, it is very easy to control everything in a branch when developing alone, but the scenario changes a lot when we have to interact with more contributors, whether in an open source or private project.

At these times, it is extremely important to have total control of what is being produced by your team, where, at the same time, errors are corrected, new features are implemented and your production code is fully delivered to your customer.

**master** will contain all code already tested, versioned that will be delivered to the client and **develop** is where all workflow will take place before making the versioned release that will be merged into **master** .

**develop** should always contain the most current code, where the branches of features will be branched based on it.

Example, suppose you need to create a feature that will change the entire flow and interface of a component, as we would do to create our branch?

Make sure the develop branch exists in your remote repository by listing your local and remote branches:

```
 $ git branch -a
```

If not, synchronize your remote repository, check it out by creating your develop branch and send it to your remote repository:

```
$ git fetch origin && git checkout -b develop && git push origin develop
```

After creating develop, where all development will take place, create the respective branch for your implementation, remember to maintain a naming standard to facilitate understanding as suggested in git flow:

**feature**: for new implementations

**release**: to finalize the release and tags

**hotfix**: to solve a critical production problem that cannot wait for a new release

In this case, as we are already at **develop**:

```
$ git checkout -b feature/new-component
```

Once created, you work on your modification locally, if it is necessary for someone else to work on this same implementation you must share it to your remote repository:

```
$ git push origin feature/new-component
```

Show, implementation done, now it's time to merge this feature with develop, for this, check out the branch develop, merge the feature and update the remote:

```
$ git checkout develop && git merge feature/novo-componente && git push origin develop
```

If there is no conflict, ok, we are ready to release this implementation and submit it to the remote repository, for this, create the release branch and send:

```
$ git checkout -b release/v1.0.1 && git push origin release/v1.0.1
```

After doing the last tests, you can now tag the version:

```
$ git tag -a v1.0.1 -m “New component release”
```

Remembering that if a bug was identified during the process, you should address this bug in the release branch, send it to the master and to develop as well, making sure that develop always contains corrections.

When inserting the tag, I like to use annotated tags, as it records information about who made the tag, date, hash, if you don't want this information, simplify:

```
$ git tag v1.0.1
```

Now let's check if the tag was created and send it to the remote repository:

```
$ git show v1.0.1 && git push origin v1.0.1
```

If everything went well, your tag will be created and we are able to merge with the master of this small release on the master:

```
$ git checkout master && git merge release/v1.0.1
```

XABLAU

Ready, this way, we obtain information from all stages of development, in addition to standardizing the nomenclature of the branches, making it easier to pull a naughty log.

Tip: There is a plugin to facilitate the creation and organization of your repository using the flow of git-flow, connect in this plugin mass!

## Notes

Space to add development notes:

Update branch with develop:

```
git merge develop
```

To delete the branch locally:

```
git branch -D <branch name>
```

To delete the branch remotely:

```
git push <origin name> <branch name> --delete
```

Take the branch, send her things to develop but without closing:

```
git checkout develop && git merge feature/<feature name> && git push origin develop
```
