# Roadmap [THIS IS AN EXAMPLE]

- Sketch out REST API using design-first API tool
    - seek feedback on API design from Orange3 developers, APInf team, ML community
- Create wireframe, and possibly mockups, of User Interface
- Research/choose framework(s) and libraries to commence development
    - REST framework
    - UI framework (if applicable)
    - Visualization framework (if applicable)
- Scaffold initial REST API
- Prototype initial User Interface using UI framework

# Current Status: Alpha

The project is currently in an alpha stage, which means that the code and the functionality are still changing. We haven't yet tested the system with large data sources and in many scenarios. We invite you to try it and welcome any feedback.

# [PROJECT] Features [HELK EXAMPLE]

* **Kafka:** A distributed publish-subscribe messaging system that is designed to be fast, scalable, fault-tolerant, and durable.
* **Elasticsearch:** A highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine.

There are a few things that I would like to accomplish with the [REPOSITORY] as shown in the To-Do list below. I would love to make the [REPOSITORY] a stable build for everyone in the community. If you are interested on making this build a more robust one and adding some cool features to it, PLEASE feel free to submit a pull request.

IF NEEDED FOR THE PROJECT, HERE ARE IDEAS OF INFORMATION TO ADD TO THE WIKI

## (Docker) Accessing the Images

## General UI widgets

## Graph/data flow widgets

## Flow-based programming environments

## Visualization

## Existing tools

### REST framework(s)

### Machine Learning Framework(s)

### Machine Learning User Interface(s)

### Machine Learning REST Interface(s)
  
  #### Machine Learning as a Service

## Design

The design will most likely consist of a REST API and User Interface, developed as separate components.

### API

A REST API would make it easy to use Machine Learning algorithms, since users would not have to install or maintain the ML software.

Insert structure:

- **Data** - widgets for data handling (import, export, random data generation, processing etc)
- **Visualize** - widgets to represent data in various forms (scatter plot, tree, histogram, etc)
- **Model** - widgets to analyze data and pick predictive algorithm(s)
- **Evaluate** - widgets to test the strength of chosen predictive algorithm(s)
- **Unsupervised** - widgets for selecting unsupervised learning models (probably can be combined under the Model section of the API)

### UI
