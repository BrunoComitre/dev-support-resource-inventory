# How to Select Modules:

## WHY?

1. licenses
   - Checking which licenses the modules use is essential to know whether or not I can use them in my project
   - Do not use [BAD LICENSES](https://github.com/ErikMcClure/bad-licenses)
2. All Open Source Software is developed by a Human Being
   - If the person disappears, how will you continue to use or maintain the Library?
3. Maybe you don't need a library, or the lib you chose doesn't solve your problem right
   - A queue system, date management, maybe it is better to create a queue management and a date management, than to create a Library and be hostage of this Software, in case it gets Deprecated

## 5 steps to decide to use Modules

1. do I need this ?
   - I can maybe implement it natively

2) Does it really do what I need ?
   - Does it really fulfill all the needs I am developing for my Software
3) Is it maintained by Sane People?
   - Check the repository description and if the people who created it are really maintainers of the active projects, their issues and commits are constant

4. how is it implemented?
   - Read the Module code, and understand how it is implemented
     If I were to implement this, how much time would I spend?
   - Do a mental exercise of how much time, how many lines of code and how I would build this particularity to my Software

## Always Remember!

**Always be wary of Modules**
